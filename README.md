# commandGOLF

**commandGOLF** is a command-line interface (CLI) golf game built in Python, offering a simplified yet captivating golfing experience directly from your terminal.
Engage in a game of golf where strategy, club selection, and dealing with the whims of the wind come together to challenge your path to the least number of swings to get the ball in the hole.

### **Features** 

-   **Club Selection**: Choose from an array of clubs, each with unique attributes, to tackle the distance to the hole under varying wind conditions.

-   **Wind Influence**: Experience the impact of headwinds, tailwinds, and crosswinds on your shots, adding a layer of strategy to each decision.

-   **Putting Mechanic**: Master the green with a putting mechanic that demands careful consideration of strength and precision.

-   **Variable Hole Play**: Choose to play a quick round, a half-course, or a full 18-hole game, with each hole featuring randomized distances and wind conditions for endless replayability.

-   **Scorecard Feature**: Track your progress with a running scorecard that updates after each hole, providing immediate feedback on your performance and a final summary upon completion of the game.
